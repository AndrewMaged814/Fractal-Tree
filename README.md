Fractal Tree

The tree is drawn recursively using OpenGL's GL_LINES primitive, and its angle and length can be adjusted by the user using the keyboard.




## Installation

To run this code, you need to have the PyOpenGL library installed. You can install it using pip by running the following command in your terminal:

```Terminal
pip install PyOpenGL-3.1.6-cp37-cp37m-win32.whl

```
    

## Features


You can adjust the angle and length of the branches using the keyboard:

- Press q to increase the angle between branches by 0.5 degrees.
- Press e to decrease the angle between branches by 0.5 degrees.
- Press w to increase the length of the branches by 1%.
- Press s to decrease the length of the branches by 1%.

The fractal tree will update in real-time as you adjust its parameters.
